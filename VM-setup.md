# Setting up VirtualBox

The TechFocus III practical sessions will require the use of very specialized software, as such, we will be providing attendees with a virtual environment that already contains all of the tools and sample files we will be using. In order to use this virtual environemnt there are some setup steps that you *must* take prior to the TechFocus III conference.
